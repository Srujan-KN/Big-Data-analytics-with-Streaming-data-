This repository is for Big Data Final project at PES University to analyse various events that happen in a football league (Fantasy Premier League).<br>
These events are associated to many metrics such as playersâ€™ free kick effectiveness, pass accuracy , duel effectiveness , etc. We use streaming data for the analysis.<br>
The matches and the events data were streamed through port 6100, code for which was provided and we used Streaming Spark to read the streamed data.<br>
The players and teams data were stored in hdfs and taken as command line arguments while running the code. <br>
Here we have two files namely master.py and stream.py<br>
Commands to run the above files on linux :(on seperate Terminal)<br>
$ python3 stream.py<br>
$ spark-submit master.py hdfs://localhost:9000/"players.csv-file path in hdfs" hdfs://localhost:9000/"teams.csv-file path in hdfs" > output.txt<br>
Here, output.txt is the output file to which we redirected the output<br>
